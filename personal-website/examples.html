            <h2>Short Story Example</h2>
            <p>A short story I've written all stemmed from learning about the Korean War. I had never heard of it previously, but its other title the "Forgotten War" truly stood out. I asked questions such as: </p>
            <p>"Who was involved in this war?" "Why was it forgotten?" "Did anything bizarre happen in the war or its aftermath?"</p>
            <p>Here's the story if you wish to read it:</p>

                <p>I had seen many videos of dioramas being made and found the process fascinating. I happened to have a styrofoam pumpkin that I thought would make a good base. My questions were as follows: </p>
                <p>"What are common plant related dioramas?" "Can I make it a holiday decoration?" "What materials do I have on hand or would be easy to get?"</p>
                <p>Ideas aren't always concept based, but can also include gauging your limits.</p>

                <h2>School Recipe</h2>
                <p>For a cooking class I took part in in highschool, I was made to create a dessert recipe with a random set of ingredients I was given. Aside from those guidelines, we were free to be as creative as we wanted. I loved learning how to make a cake roll and wanted to make one again. The questions my group had to ask were the following:</p>
                <p>"How do we make use of the more unusual ingredients?" "Can we combine these two items since they are similar?" "Will this items texture be noticed in the cake?"</p>
                <p>As a school assignment, the questions also need to factor in the limits within the assignment. Keep the limits in mind, but don't let it crush your inspiration!</p>
