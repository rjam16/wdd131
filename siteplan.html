          A Untapped Well of Ideas

          We all know an "idea man". Someone everyone goes to when in a creative block. Think of this process as your idea man, a guide to find your muse.
          
            Pick a Point of Interest
            Find something that sticks out to you
          
            Ask Any and All Questions
            Challenge your brain to think outside the box  
          
            Repeat...
            Keep using the first two steps to fully flesh-out the idea
          
            Finding a Muse 
            Depending on what you want an idea for, we all have something that perks our interest. For work and school, the point of intrigue is a little more contained in possibilites. This may make your job easier or harder depending on what project you are currently working on. As for more creative works, the ideas are open-ended. There in lies the problem. With limitless possibilites, it can be difficult to direct your thought process to only one. For this process, choose something you've come across that sparks curiousity. Anything from a science fact to a single word can produce this spark.  
            Outside of the Box
            Great, you've chosen a starting point. The next step is to expand on the interest you found. You do this by asking questions. No matter how obvious the question may seem, it's helping direct your mind to a more substantial thought process. Some questions can remain unanswered, but it's best to answer the question that spark the most curiosity. 
            Repeat
            Continue finding point of interest and asking numerous questions. You can stop this process when you feel ready to put your new idea to use.

        Paragraphs:
          Stories
          A short story I've written all stemmed from learning about the Korean War. I had never heard of it previously, but its other title the "Forgotten War" truly stood out. I asked questions such as: "who was involved in this war?" "why was it forgotten?" "did anything bizarre happen in the war or its aftermath?"
          Art piece
          I had seen many videos of dioramas being made and found the process fascinating. I happened to have a styrofoam pumpkin that I thought would make a good base. My questions were as follows: "what are common plant related dioramas?" "Can I make it a holiday decoration?" "What materials do I have on hand or would be easy to get?" 
          School assignment
          For a cooking class I took part in in highschool, I was made to create a dessert recipe with a random set of ingredients I was given. Aside from those guidelines, we were free to be as creative as we wanted. I loved learning how to make a cake roll and wanted to make one again. The questions my group had to ask were the following:"How do we make use of the more unusual ingredients?" "Can we combine these two items since they are similar?" "Will this items texture be noticed in the cake?"
